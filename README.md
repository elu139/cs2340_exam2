# Goals
## Add the following user stories:
### 1. As a User, I want to see a map showing which movies of the GT Movie Store are trending (or most purchased) in different geographic areas, so I can discover what's popular around me or in other regions.
### 2. As a User, I want to rate movies (e.g., 1-5 stars) so I can quickly share feedback without writing a full review.

## Note: Assignment 2 codebase is derived from Ethan Lu's Movies Store codebase. Since all five team members made revisions to their codebases via Python Anywhere directly, it was agreed to start a new GitHub repo based on Ethan's codebase since his repo had the least number of updates needed to be made.
